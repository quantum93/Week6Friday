## Description
 Finding a doctor that provides the services you need nearby can be time consuming. To facilitate this, we create a website where users may enter a medical issue (ie: “sore throat”, "rash", etc.) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of doctors in your city (Portland or Seattle depending on where you are) who can treat their medical issue.

### Specs
